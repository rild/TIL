Mixture Density Networks

- Minimization of a sum-of-squares
- cross-entropy error function

outputs which approximate the conditional averages of the target data

classifications problems

- with a suitably chosen target coding scheme
  - represent the posterior probabilities of class membership
  - regarded as optimal
- for problems involving the prediction of continuous variables
  - provide only a very limited description of the properties of the target variables

the mapping to be learned is multi-valued

the conditional probabilities distribution of the target data

new class of network models

the central goal in network training
to model the *underlaying generator*
of the data
